# City Of Champions 
-Web Project by Nicholas Lawson

Every year, different cities win championships in popular US sports. The city typically celebrates by throwing a parade for a winning team. This website will award a city the "City of Champions" award based off of the most popular sports leagues.   

Website would show yearly accumulation of all championship team cities in a US map. A city is more qualified if their championship team's league is more popular in viewership from a national perspective than another. For example, let's say that the Houston Rockets won the NBA Finals and the New York Giants won the Super Bowl. Given that the super bowl's national viewership will be more than likely higher the NBA Finals, New York City would be deemed a better qualifier to be awarded with the "City of Champions" trophy.

A secondary award will also be awarded as the "State of Champions". Same rules apply but to states instead of cities.
